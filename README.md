# [DJ LOM Website](https://cjepps.github.io/Milestone-One/)

<img src="assets/images/Screenshots/djlom-responsive.PNG" alt="DJ LOM Home Page" width="800">

In this project I will create a website to promote my Djing. I will centralise my mixes that are currently hosted on several external sites (Youtube, Mixcloud). I will also promote my original music here as well as providing a booking form for potential clients to book me. Essentially, my experience is that a lot of people ask me at events who I am but few book me afterwards. My idea is to be able to give them a business card with a QR code linking to this website which should provide more customers and fans of my mixes and music. 

The website will be built responsively so that it looks great on all devices and accessible by all types of customer. I'm am building this webpage firstly to be optimised on mobile phones. It is my belief that this is the most likely format potenial customers and fans will view my website.   



## UX
---

### Project Goals

The Primary goal for this project is to enable potenial clients to book me as a DJ to play at their Venue.
The website will be visually appealing and showcase my work in order for potenial customers/ fans to know more about me and my work.

### User Stories

As a user, I want:

- to be able to view the site on my preferred device (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- to be given an easy way to navigate to the content i want to view.
- to be easily able to contact the DJ with any request that I have.
- to have an easy way to listen to and sample the mixes the DJ will play 
- to be provided with information that tells me more about the DJ 
- to find community links

### Design Choices

I have made the decision to create a single scrollable page as opposed to separate pages linked by a nav bar.
This is because there is not too much content to be displayed on one page and i feel this will aid in discovering other sections (mixes, buying music)



 The first section a user will see will be a hero image of myself with my DJ name visible. Here there will be a simple Navigation bar so that different types of user can find the most appropriate section for them quickly. The most important section on the page will be an about me. I will place this section directly below the main hero image so that customers who might be unfamiliar with me can find out more. This should lead to an increased chance of them scrolling to further sections.

 #### Colour scheme
 - I have decided to go with a monochromatic colour scheme, utilizing some color to highlight important sections or buttons

 #### Typography
 - Roboto is used as the main font with sans-serif as the fallback in case this is not loaded correctly. I have also used Audiowide to style the logo and sub-headings on the page.
 #### Imagery
 - I have chosen to use a fullscreen hero image of myself djing to grab the attention of users. It is the first thing they see when entering the website and it immediately lets the user know that they are on a DJ page. In the about me section, i have chosen to include a profile image of myself to make the page more personal.

 - In the bookings section i have chosen to use a colourful background image to highlight this section. This is one of the most important sections on the site as it should provide business to myself as a DJ.

 ### Bookings section and Footer
  * This section provides users a means to get in contact with me. Either to find out more about me or to book me for an event.
  * I've provided a footer so that users can easily access my facebook DJ profile, bandcamp, and Youtube channel which should enable me to increase my online visibility and obtain more customers.

### Testing user stories from UX section

As a user I want to be able to view the site on my preferred device (mobile, tablet, desktop)

- Manual testing was undertaken to ensure that each section of the page was viewed correctly at major resolutions

As a user I want to be given an easy way to navigate to the content i want to view.

- The page has been designed to include a navigation bar with a fixed position that is viewable wherever you are on the page. The links are clean and clear, with appropriate titles.

- Users viewing the page on devices with smaller resolutions are presented with an expanding menu that provides bigger navigation links to be clearer.
