# DJ LOM Website

In this project I will create a website to promote my Djing. I will centralise my mixes that are currently hosted on several external sites (Youtube, Mixcloud). I will also promote my original music here as well as providing a booking form for potential clients to book me. Essentially, my experience is that a lot of people ask me at events who I am but few book me afterwards. My idea is to be able to give them a business card with a QR code linking to this website which should provide more customers and fans of my mixes and music. 

The website will be built responsively so that it looks great on all devices and accessible by all types of customer. I'm am building this webpage firstly to be optimised on mobile phones. It is my belief that this is the most likely format potenial customers and fans will view my website.   



## UX

### Project Goals

The Primary goal for this project is to enable potenial clients to book me as a DJ to play at their Venue.
The website will be visually appealing and showcase my work in order for potenial customers/ fans to know more about me and my work.

### User Stories

As a potential client I want:
-	The ability to quickly access the booking/ contact form to hire the DJ for an event 
-	A section I can find out more about the DJ if I am not completely familiar with the DJ
-	Examples of the DJs work to understand if the DJ is right for my venue

As a fan/ potential fan of the DJ I want:
-	An easy way to find out more about the DJ
-	To Listen to more of the DJs music 
-	To be provided with links to access the Djs social media, youtube channel, bandcamp to buy the Djs music 


### Design Choices

I have made the decision to create a single scrollable page as opposed to separate pages linked by a nav bar.
This is because there is not too much content to be displayed on one page and i feel this will aid in discovering other sections (mixes, buying music)



 The first section a user will see will be a hero image of myself with my DJ name visable. Here there will be a simple Navigation bar so that different types of user can find the most appropriate section for them quickly. The most important section on the page will be an about me. I will place this section directly below the main hero image so that customers who might be unfamiliar with me can find out more. This should lead to an increased chance of them scrolling to further sections.
